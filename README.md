# FLOOD_AND_LANDSLIDE_ROUTEOPTIMIZATION
This project provides a real-time disaster management solution by tracking floods and landslides and suggesting optimized safe routes for evacuation and transportation. It integrates live data feeds, geospatial mapping, and AI-based route optimization to enhance safety and reduce risks during natural calamitie
#Features

🌍 Real-time Monitoring: Tracks flood and landslide-prone areas using live data from APIs, sensors, and satellite feeds.

🗺 Interactive Maps: Visual representation of affected zones with severity indicators.

🔄 Route Optimization: Suggests alternative safe paths based on roadblocks, water levels, and terrain stability.

📡 Alert System: Provides instant notifications and warnings for nearby risks.

📊 Data Analytics: Historical disaster data analysis for better preparedness.

# How It Works

Collects real-time flood & landslide data from multiple data sources.

Processes the data to detect danger zones.

Updates the map interface with high-risk areas.

Runs route optimization algorithms (Dijkstra/A* with constraints).

Provides users with safe navigation routes and alerts.
# Use Cases

🚑 Emergency Services: Ambulances & rescue teams can find quickest safe routes.

🚍 Public Transport: Rerouting buses away from blocked areas.

🚶 General Public: People in disaster zones get real-time navigation assistance.

🏛 Government Agencies: For disaster preparedness & relief planning.
